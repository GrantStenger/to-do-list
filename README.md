First, you need to make a MySQL database and table. Do this by running "php initializeSQL.php".
Second, run "php -S localhost:8000".
Third, open "http://localhost:8000/" in chrome.
Fourth, have fun.

To Do's for me:
Clear "New task bar" after adding a task
Make able to add task with enter

lil bootstrap too
